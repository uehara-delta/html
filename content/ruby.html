      <h1>What is Ruby?</h1>

      <p>
        Ruby is a dynamic, interpreted, reflective, object-oriented, general-purpose programming
        language.  It was designed and developed in the mid-1990s by Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto in
        Japan.
      </p>

      <p>
        According to the creator, Ruby was influenced by Perl, Smalltalk, Eiffel, Ada, and Lisp.
        It supports multiple programming paradigms, including functional, object-oriented, and
        imperative.  It also has a dynamic type system and automatic memory management.

          <h3>Early concept</h3>

          <p>
            Matsumoto has said that Ruby was conceived in 1993. In a 1999 post to the ruby-talk
            mailing list, he describes some of his early ideas about the language:
          </p>

          <blockquote>
            I was talking with my colleague about the possibility of an object-oriented scripting
            language. I knew Perl (Perl4, not Perl5), but I didn't like it really, because it had
            the smell of a toy language (it still has). The object-oriented language seemed very
            promising. I knew Python then. But I didn't like it, because I didn't think it was a
            true object-oriented language – OO features appeared to be add-on to the language. As a
            language maniac and OO fan for 15 years, I really wanted a genuine object-oriented,
            easy-to-use scripting language. I looked for but couldn't find one. So I decided to make
            it.
          </blockquote>

          <p>
            Matsumoto describes the design of Ruby as being like a simple Lisp language at its core,
            with an object system like that of Smalltalk, blocks inspired by higher-order functions,
            and practical utility like that of Perl.
          </p>

            <h4>The name "Ruby"</h4>

            <p>
              The name "Ruby" originated during an online chat session between Matsumoto and Keiju
              Ishitsuka on February 24, 1993, before any code had been written for the language.
              Initially two names were proposed: "Coral" and "Ruby". Matsumoto chose the latter in a
              later e-mail to Ishitsuka. Matsumoto later noted a factor in choosing the name "Ruby"
              – it was the birthstone of one of his colleagues.
